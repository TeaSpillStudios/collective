## Why Rust-focused?

| Reason                         | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Focused Effort                 | In the future, we want to use more than just Rust. However, it is important to focus on one language at a time. This will allow us to focus on the core features of the project, and then expand to other languages. |
| Human-readable compiler errors | Rust has high quality, human-readable compiler errors which makes LLMs be able to understand what is going on.                                                                                                       |
| General purpose language       | Rust is a general purpose language which means it can do most things with it.                                                                                                                                        |
| Popularity                     | Rust is currently a popular language which means more people will be able to use it. We can ride the Rust + LLM hype train.                                                                                          |
